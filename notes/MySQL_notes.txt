1. Download & Install the MySQL Server + MySQL WorkBench Desktop Applications
   The installation process automatically implements a root user/pw for the local instance.
   The local instance is 127.0.0.1 (port 3306 by default)
2. Create simple user_table for Proof of Concept (test authentication with nglenno18 gmail user)
3. Update the configuration file to connect to the localhost instance (this will be updated when the configuration file is split into LOCAL/DEV/PROD)
4. Run npm start and attempt to log into the localhost site through the test user's gmail account
